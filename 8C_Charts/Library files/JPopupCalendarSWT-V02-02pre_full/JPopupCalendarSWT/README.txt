To build the JPopupMenu.jar file run 
ant   or
ant makejar

in the main release directory. That will create a classes subdirectory with
all the class files and a lib directory with the JPopupMenu.jar file.

A simple example can be found in the samples folder. To run it just run

ant build SimpleExample1
 
(or SimpleExample2 or SimpleExample3) in the 'sample' subdirectory.
