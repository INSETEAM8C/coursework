ChangeLog:


12/17/05
  o Removed the DateSelectionListener again. Instead PopupCalendar now
    uses SelectionEvents/SelectionListener to notify that a date was selected.
    
  o DateChooser is now a fully functional widget on it's own.
  
  o Removed all memory leaks caused by not disposing graphics objects 
    (custom colors and fonts).
    
  o Added a PopupShellManager, which allows to simply add the same popup
    functionality to any widget. It provides and manages a popup shell 
    which then can be used like any other shell.

  o Sped up updating of the popup calendar by a factor ~6-7. Changing months 
    now takes ~10ms on my 1.5Mhz P-IV laptop.
    
  o Changed to package name to net.cwroethel.swt.popupcalendar for the swt 
    release.
    
  o Added additional examples for using the PopupShellManager and the standalone
    DateChooser.

PopupCalendar:

  o Renamed JPopupCalendar to PopupCalendar.
  
  o Changed Constructor parameters to be more SWT like:
       PopupCalendar(Shell shell, int style);
     or 
       PopupCalendar(Shell shell, int style, Locale locale);
       
       
  o Style definition:
     - style options in PopupCalendar now include positioning of the 
       popup window relative to a composite. Allowed parameters for 
       positioning are: 
         PopupCalendar.LEFT, PopupCalendar.RIGHT, PopupCalendar.CENTER
         or the equivalent styles in SWT, e.g. SWT.RIGHT.
       and for selecting which calendar components to show:
         PopupCalendar.SHOWTODAY, PopupCalendar.SHOWMONTH, 
         PopupCalendar.SHOWALL.
         Use bitwise or (|) to select more than one option.
                 
  o DateSelectionEvents/DateSelectionListener now instead of the 
    ActionListener/ActionEvents. This makes it now a 'pure' SWT 
    implementation.

  o added methods: showMonthSelector and showTodaySelector to hide direct
    access to DateChooser instance data. DateChooser.showMonthSelector and
    DateChooser.showTodaySelector are now private. However selecting the 
    components can now be made with the style parameter in the constructor.   

  o added methods resetDates() and resetSelectedDate() to managed the 
    displayed date and selected date of DateChooser.
 
  o Removed options to automatically reset the current and selected dates
    (former options RESET_AT_SHOW and SAVE_SELECTED_DATE. Instead the 
    resetDates() and resetSelectedDate() methods should be used.
     
  o added an additional open() method. This method takes the a control only
    and uses the style defined in the constructor to place the popup window.
 
  o Cleaned up the looks of the calendar a bit. The calendar is now a bit
    more compact in it's appearance without making it actually smaller.
    
  
DateChooser:       
  o Style definition now takes PopupCalendar.SHOWALL, 
        PopupCalendar.SHOWMONTH and PopupCalendar.SHOWTODAY.
        
 
 Updating from previous versions:
   For typical users:
     o Update your constructor. Use the style PopupCalendar.SHOWALL if 
       you're not sure which style to select.
       
     o Update the listener: 
       Replace popupCal.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
         public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { 
         ...
       with 
       popupCal.addDateSelectionListener(new DateSelectionListener() {
         public void dateSelected(DateSelectionEvent e) {
         ...
         
      Everything else should stay the same, i.e. the DateSelectionEvent is
      similar enough to ActionEvent to avoid further changes.
      
    o replace calendar component selections using instance date, e.g. 
        ...
        popupCal.showMonthSelector = false;
        ...
      with the method with the same name:
        ...
        popupCal.showMonthSelector(false);
        ...
      or better even use the style option in the constructor.
 
    o reset the dates yourself if you were using the RESET_AT_SHOW 
      and SAVE_SELECTED_DATE options.
